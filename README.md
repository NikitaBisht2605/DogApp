### Introduction ✅:
<p>
  In today's world, everyone loves to have a pet but, taking care of it is another task. The problem here comes when we are unaware of how to proceed, what to feed and what to follow. The crucial  thing is Training the pet and should be taught at the right age. So what if we have a source ( Android Application) that gives food charts, reminders, Vet visits, Training schedule, Contacts with Vet at a click.

### Problem Solution💡:
<p>
  So to deal with all these problems. We created an app that will help us in taking care of our pets in a more efficient and professional manner. We can schedule our pets’ vet meet, vaccinations and food timings. The app will also give detailed information about the pets for example which type food is best for them, how much grooming is required for them, what type exercise they should do, etc. We can also find the nearest vet centre for our pets in an emergency. And to get answers to our queries
</p>

### Novelty📕:
<p>
  We have come across many apps which for animal care which only provides function to save data for pets, For example - When the pet had last bath or grooming or vaccination etc. So, generally pet owners doesn't get idea about taking proper care of the pet. So this project will allow user to take photos of pet and the app will provide the important information related to proper caring, For example - Vaccination or Water or Food or Walk scheduled, training to be provided, adoption centers and many more.
