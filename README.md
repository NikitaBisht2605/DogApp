### Introduction ‚úÖ:
<p>
  In today's world, everyone loves to have a pet but, taking care of it is another task. The problem here comes when we are unaware of how to proceed, what to feed and what to follow. The crucial  thing is how to train the pet and at which age. So what if we have a source ( Android Application) that gives food charts, reminders, Vet visits, Training schedule, Contacts with Vet at a click.
 
</p>

### Problem Solutionüí°:
<p>
  So to deal with all these problems. We created an app that will help us in taking care of our pets in a more efficient and professional manner. We can schedule our pets‚Äô vet meet, vaccinations and food timings. The app will also give detailed information for example what kind of food is best for them, what type of exercise they should do, etc. We can also find the nearest vet centre for our pets in any kind of emergency and solutions for most of the doubts regarding our pets.
</p>

### Noveltyüìï:
<p>
  We have come across many apps for animal care which only provides function to save data for pets, For example - When the pet had last bath or grooming or vaccination etc. So this project will allow user to take photos of pet and the app will provide the important information related to proper caring, For example - Vaccination or Water or Food or Walk scheduled, training to be provided, adoption centers and many more. This app will also help the user to know the if their pets are suffering from any disease or not and also provide them with proper medications.
</p>

### Tech Stack üìö:
- Android Studio
- Figma
- Firebase
- Decision tree
- CNN for pet classification

### Additional Features:
<p>
We are also planning to add a feature with whose help the user can find their lost pets through voice recognition. The user has to record the voice of their pet while registering in the app for the first time. When someone finds a lost pet they just need to input the voice of the pet again and our app will search in its database by matching the voice of the found pet with the already available voices. If it matches then the address and contact of the pet owner will be provided.
</p>

### Conclusion üîç:
<p>
  This is an app which anyone and everyone who has a pet can use. It basically makes life simpler for pet owners in multiple ways. You can take care of your pet in the best way possible and even train them . Also now things being online we can't take pets out for walks often so we even suggest what will keep them fit and so many more features. It will be an one stop solution to most of the issues pet owners face.
